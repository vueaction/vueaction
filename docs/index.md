features:
  - title: Simple To Use, Easy To Configure
    details: useAction is a simple, gorgeous composable that any junior dev will understand immediately however... there are many ways to hook into actions, and configure their types so that they're far easier to consume!
    
  - title: Invisible Lines Of Communication
    details: We built VueAction to create more clarity between front/backend devs. Senior devs can write complex backend actions, create types for those actions, then make them easy for junior devs to use in the frontend.

  - title: Componentable
    details: The "useAction" API is an interface. This means you can build components using this interface, and use those components for ALL your actions!
